"""HandlerBuildLoop — FSM state machine for the autonomous build loop.

Pure state machine logic. Each phase transition is driven by external
callers feeding phase completion results. The handler does not perform
external I/O — it only manages state transitions, emits phase transition
events, and enforces the circuit breaker.

FSM: IDLE -> CLOSING_OUT -> VERIFYING -> FILLING -> CLASSIFYING -> BUILDING -> COMPLETE
     Any phase failure increments consecutive_failures.
     3 consecutive failures -> FAILED (circuit breaker).
