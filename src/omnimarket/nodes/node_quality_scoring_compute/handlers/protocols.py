"""Type protocols for quality scoring handler results.

This module defines TypedDict structures for type-safe handler responses,
enabling static type checking with mypy and improved IDE support.

Design Decisions:
    - TypedDict is used because handlers return dicts, not objects with methods.
    - All scores are normalized to 0.0-1.0 range for consistency.
    - Required fields use total=True (default) for strict validation.
    - DimensionScores provides type-safe dimension field access.

Usage:
    from omnimarket.nodes.node_quality_scoring_compute.handlers.protocols import (
        DimensionScores,
        QualityScoringResult,
    )

    def score_code_quality(...) -> QualityScoringResult:
        return {
            "success": True,
            "quality_score": 0.85,
            ...
        }
