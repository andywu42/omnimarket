"""ONEX configuration presets for quality scoring.

Pre-configured weight sets and thresholds for different
ONEX compliance strictness levels. Presets enable users to quickly apply
standardized quality requirements without manually configuring all parameters.

Strictness Levels:
    - STRICT: Production-ready code with high quality bar. Emphasizes documentation
      and pattern adherence. Use for production deployments and code reviews.
    - STANDARD: Default balanced requirements suitable for most use cases.
      Provides good coverage across all dimensions without being overly strict.
    - LENIENT: Development/prototyping mode with lower quality bar. More forgiving
      on documentation and pattern requirements. Use for rapid prototyping,
      exploratory code, or legacy code assessment.

Weight Distribution:
    All presets use weights that sum to 1.0 across six dimensions:
    - complexity: Cyclomatic complexity (inverted - lower is better)
    - maintainability: Code structure and naming conventions
    - documentation: Docstring and comment coverage
    - temporal_relevance: Code freshness indicators
    - patterns: ONEX pattern adherence
    - architectural: Module organization

Usage:
    from omnimarket.nodes.node_quality_scoring_compute.handlers.presets import (
        OnexStrictnessLevel,
        get_weights_for_preset,
        get_threshold_for_preset,
    )

    # Get preset configuration
    weights = get_weights_for_preset(OnexStrictnessLevel.STRICT)
    threshold = get_threshold_for_preset(OnexStrictnessLevel.STRICT)

    # Use with score_code_quality
    result = score_code_quality(
        content=code,
        language="python",
        weights=weights,
        onex_threshold=threshold,
    )

Example:
    >>> from omnimarket.nodes.node_quality_scoring_compute.handlers.presets import (
    ...     OnexStrictnessLevel,
    ...     get_weights_for_preset,
    ...     get_threshold_for_preset,
    ... )
    >>> weights = get_weights_for_preset(OnexStrictnessLevel.STANDARD)
    >>> sum(weights.values())
    1.0
    >>> threshold = get_threshold_for_preset(OnexStrictnessLevel.STANDARD)
    >>> threshold
    0.7
