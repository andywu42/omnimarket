# {{SKILL_DISPLAY_NAME}} (OmniMarket)

## Overview

Thin event-bus wrapper around the OmniMarket `{{NODE_NAME}}` node. This skill
publishes a command event and monitors for completion — all business logic
executes in the node handler.

**Announce at start:** "Running {{SKILL_SLUG}} via OmniMarket event bus."

## Execution

### Step 1 — Assemble payload

Collect arguments from the user invocation and build the command payload:

```json
{
  "correlation_id": "<uuid4>",
  "{{PAYLOAD_FIELD_1}}": "{{EXAMPLE_VALUE_1}}",
  "{{PAYLOAD_FIELD_2}}": "{{EXAMPLE_VALUE_2}}"
}
```

Omit fields the user did not specify — the node applies its own defaults.

### Step 2 — Publish command event

Publish to topic: `{{COMMAND_TOPIC}}`

Source: `contract.yaml → event_bus.subscribe_topics[0]`

### Step 3 — Monitor completion

Listen on topic: `{{COMPLETION_TOPIC}}`

Source: `contract.yaml → event_bus.publish_topics[0]`

Filter by `correlation_id`. Timeout: **{{TIMEOUT_MS}} ms** (from contract `descriptor.timeout_ms`).

### Step 4 — Format output

On success, render the completion payload in a format appropriate for the skill's
output type. On timeout or error, report the failure clearly.

## CLI

```
/{{SKILL_SLUG}}                    # Default invocation
/{{SKILL_SLUG}} --example-flag     # With options
```

## Important

This wrapper contains **no business logic**. Do not add domain logic here.
All processing is handled by the `{{NODE_NAME}}` node in
`omnimarket/nodes/{{NODE_DIR}}/`.
