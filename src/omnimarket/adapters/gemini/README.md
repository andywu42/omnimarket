# Gemini CLI Adapter — OmniMarket

## Overview

Gemini CLI adapters are instruction files placed in the `.gemini/` directory that
tell the Gemini CLI agent how to invoke OmniMarket packages via the ONEX event bus.
Each instruction file describes the event-publish/monitor pattern for a single node.
**No business logic lives in the instruction file.**

## How it works

1. The Gemini CLI reads instruction files from `.gemini/` in the project root
2. When the user requests the relevant operation, the agent publishes a command event
3. The OmniMarket node picks up the command, executes, and publishes a completion event
4. The agent monitors for the completion event and formats the result

## File conventions

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `aislop-sweep.md` | Example instructions for the aislop-sweep node |
| `template.md` | Generic template with placeholders for new instructions |

Instructions are loaded by placing them in `.gemini/` in the project root.

## Wrapper responsibilities

1. **Argument collection and validation** — Parse user-provided arguments and map
   them to the event payload schema from `contract.yaml`.
2. **Command options mapping** — Translate arguments into the structured event
   payload fields expected by the node.
3. **Correlation ID generation** — Generate a unique `correlation_id` (UUID v4) for
   each invocation to track request/response pairs on the bus.
4. **Event publishing** — Publish the command event to the node's `subscribe_topics`
   topic with the assembled payload and correlation ID.
5. **Completion monitoring** — Listen on the node's `publish_topics` topic, filtering
   by correlation ID, with a configurable timeout.
6. **Output formatting** — Transform the completion event payload into a clear
   response for the user.
7. **Timeout and error handling** — If no completion event arrives within the node's
   `descriptor.timeout_ms`, report a timeout error. Surface any error payloads
   from the completion event clearly.

## Creating new instructions

1. Copy `template.md` to `<skill-name>.md`
2. Replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values using the node's `contract.yaml`
3. Place the resulting file in `.gemini/` in the target project root
